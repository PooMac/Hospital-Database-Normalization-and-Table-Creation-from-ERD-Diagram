# Hospital Database Normalization and Table Creation from ERD Diagram
This project involves the transformation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing a hospital database into a set of SQL create table commands. Additionally, the project includes the application of normalization techniques to optimize the database structure.

# Project Overview
Welcome to the Hospital Database Normalization and Table Creation Project! This project focuses on converting an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing a hospital database into SQL create table commands. Additionally, the project involves the application of normalization techniques to optimize the database structure.

# Project Phases
1. ERD to SQL Conversion
In this phase, the ERD will be translated into SQL create table commands. Each entity, relationship, and attribute identified in the ERD will have corresponding SQL statements, ensuring the accurate representation of the conceptual model in the database schema.

2. Normalization
The second phase involves the application of normalization principles to enhance the efficiency and integrity of the database. This includes organizing data into well-structured tables, eliminating redundancy, and addressing dependency issues. The normalization process will ensure a robust and efficient database design.
